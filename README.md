# Hi there! 👋

I'm a hobbyist developer who enjoys tinkering with code in my spare time. I like learning new technologies and working on small projects for fun. When I'm not coding, you'll find me experimenting with different frameworks, solving interesting problems, and exploring the endless possibilities of software development.

I'm particularly fascinated by efficient computing and making powerful tools accessible even with limited resources. Whether it's optimizing code performance or finding creative ways to work within constraints, I enjoy the challenge of building something useful with what I have. This interest naturally led me to explore running AI models on consumer hardware, where efficiency and resource optimization are key.

## 🔧 Currently Learning

- 💻 **SvelteKit & JavaScript** - Building modern web applications with a focus on simplicity and performance. I love how SvelteKit makes it easy to create fast, interactive web experiences without the overhead of traditional frameworks.

- 🐍 **Python & Flask** - Creating lightweight APIs and backend services. Python's simplicity makes it perfect for quick prototypes and practical scripts, while Flask gives me just enough structure without getting in the way.

- 🦀 **Rust basics** - Exploring systems programming and performance optimization. Rust's memory safety guarantees and zero-cost abstractions are fascinating, and I'm learning how it can help build more efficient applications.

## 🎯 2026 Goal

- 🤖 **Running AI models locally with limited GPU power** - This is my big focus for 2026. I'm learning how to optimize and run machine learning models efficiently on consumer hardware. This involves exploring quantization techniques, model compression, ONNX runtime optimization, and lightweight inference frameworks. The goal is to make AI more accessible without requiring expensive hardware.
